    'Skyler was rescued from an abusive and neglectful home and is currently being fostered by a family in Encinitas. When she was first turned over to the shelter she was severely underweight and timid, though was extremely sweet and would warm up to almost anyone she met very quickly. She has since reached a healthy weight, is up to date on shots and exams, and is letting her guard down towards people more quickly. She is great with children and other dogs; and requires regular excericse and socialization. She is now ready to find her forever home. Please contact me to arrange a time to meet Skyler to see if she could be the perfect addtion to your family!',

    'Buster was a stray found in Imperial Beach and is currently housed at the IB shelter.  Although he can be timid, Buster warms up quickly and is eager to please.  He would do best at a home with another dog to keep him company.  He will require some training reinforcement and patience at first, but hes a smart guy and would make for a fiercely loyal companion.  Please come meet Buster!',

    'Brutus is playful, curious, and loyal.  He was dumped at the Scripps Ranch shelter by someone who likely never gave him the attention he deserves.  He will require some obedience training but hes eager to please and loves belly rubs!  Brutus would make a great family pet and would do best in a household with another dog.',
